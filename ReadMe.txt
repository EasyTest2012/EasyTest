Since the day I got to know EasyTest project 3 years ago, I’m impressed by the genius in the team and all the amazing work you’ve done! The EasyTest has surely became the vital automation tool that many testers can’t live without any more in their everyday work. And I have a belief that it would also be popular sooner or later as a freeware in the industry.
