ANNEX A

The Free and Open Source Software (¡°FOSS¡±) products identified below are integrated 
together with Alcatel-Lucent software to form the Licensed Software. Each of these FOSS 
products was released under a license as indicated below.  Unless otherwise dictated by 
a FOSS license (such as GPL, LGPL, and Affero GPL) that requires Alcatel-Lucent to grant 
the same rights to the parties to whom we distribute the FOSS, your rights to use, copy, 
and further distribute (if applicable) the FOSS are governed by the Alcatel-Lucent license
set forth above. 

For the avoidance of doubt, and without limiting any rights you may obtain independent of 
Alcatel-Lucent, except as set forth in the Alcatel-Lucent license above:

(i) no right is granted by Alcatel-Lucent to reproduce, modify and/or redistribute FOSS 
    that was released under and governed by a license (such as MIT, original BSD, new BSD,
	Apache, CDDL, CPL, EPL  and Mozilla) that DOES NOT require Alcatel-Lucent to grant the
	same rights to the parties to whom we distribute the FOSS, and 

(ii) no other licenses express or implied, are granted, with respect to Alcatel-Lucent 
    intellectual property, including, without limitation, Alcatel-Lucent copyrights, 
	patents, trade secrets, trademarks or logos.

(iii) In the event you are permitted to and do in fact modify any FOSS, then notwithstanding
 any other provisions to the contrary, Alcatel-Lucent will have no further liability or 
 obligation to provide support, maintenance, warranty or indemnity with respect to the 
 Alcatel-Lucent products with which the modified version of the FOSS interacts.
